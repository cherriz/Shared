        location by changing their position by + dx, +dy + dz (which can be negative values)
        ID should be unique, but it should be assigned to the object when it is created, your main program should have a 
        list of Mobile Objects, and the IDâ€™s should be created in sequence.  Names can be random or hard coded, and positions should be random.
